\subsubsection{\eco}\label{ecodata}

\paragraph{Tiling array transcriptome measurements}

We measured \eco tiling array transcriptome profiles at nine
different time points during growth in LB, spanning lag-phase (OD600 =
0.05) to stationary-phase (OD600 = 7.3). RNA samples were prepared as
in (Koide et al., 2009). Tiling arrays (Agilent) were custom designed
with 60mer probes tiled across both strands of the \eco\ 
genome using a sliding window of 23bp. Data were quantile-normalized
as in (Yoon et al., 2011) and analyzed for condition-specific
transcriptional isoforms as in (Koide et al., 2009).
