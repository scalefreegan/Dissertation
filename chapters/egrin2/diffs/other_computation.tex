\subsection{Functional enrichment estimates for genes in corems}

We computed functional enrichment for genes organized into corems
using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{DAVID (Dennis et al., 2003) and the
DAVIDQuery R-package (Day
and Lisovich, 2010)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \tmsamp{DAVID} \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Dennis2003}
}%DIFAUXCMD
and the
}\tmsamp{DAVIDQuery} \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Day2010}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\tmsamp{R}\DIFadd{-package}\DIFaddend . Enrichments for each corem are available on the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{web site}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \href{http://egrin2.systemsbiology.net}{web site}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Conditional co-regulation of genes organized in corems}
\DIFaddbegin \label{section:rsd}
\DIFaddend 

We defined the conditions in which genes in a corem were co-regulated
as the set of experiments in which the genes of a corem are more
tightly co-expressed than one would expect at chance. We statistically
evaluated tight co-expression using relative standard deviation (RSD 
$=|\sigma/\mu|$) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by }\DIFaddend resampling. We chose RSD (rather than, for example,
standard deviation, $\sigma$) to avoid over-weighting conditions in which the
mean relative expression is close to zero. The significance of an RSD
value for a given condition relative to each corem was estimated
by resampling: for a corem with $k$ gene members, and for each
condition, $c$, we computed at least 20,000 RSD values for $k$ randomly
sampled expression measurements in $c$, to determine the likelihood that the
observed co-expression has lower RSD than expected by chance ($p$-value
$< 0.01$). The resampling procedure resulted in condition sets for
corems that contained from 1.4\% to 85.5\% of the conditions in
\halo\ and 7.9\% to 66.6\% conditions in \eco\DIFaddbegin \ \DIFadd{(Figure \ref{fig:corem_stats})}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Conditionality of GRE influence}

The upstream promoter regions of most genes contain multiple EGRIN
2.0-predicted GREs (\eg, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{carA }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{carA}} \DIFaddend in Figure 2). A key insight of our model
is that not all of these sites are equally important for controlling
gene expression in all experimental conditions. We refer to changes in
the relative influence of GREs across conditions as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{â€œconditional
activityâ}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``conditional
activity'' }\DIFaddend of GRE elements. Although, to be clear, we do not imply
that the transcriptional activity at a GRE is attributable to the DNA
sequence itself, but rather the TF that binds to that sequence in
particular environments. We leveraged the GREs discovered in genes
grouped into corems and the conditional co-expression of those groups
of genes to predict conditionally active GREs in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{EGRIN
2.0}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \egrine\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Specifically, to discover }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To identify the }\DIFaddend active GREs for each corem we combined predictions
from (1) genome-wide motif scans (Section\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{section:scanning}
}\DIFaddend above) that predict the GRE locations in an expanded region around
each geneâ€™s promoter in the corem using all of the ensemble
predictions (1,000 nt window: -875 nt upstream to 125 nt downstream),
and (2) the conditions discovered in biclusters that are most
representative of the corem (\ie, containing the largest fraction of
genes from the corem, top decile). GREs that occurred frequently
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{inÂ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend these biclusters were considered putatively responsible for
co-regulating the set of genes in the condition-specific context of
the corem (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{q-value â‰¤
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$q$-value $\leq$ }\DIFaddend 0.05). Finally, we computed the average distances
of all GREs to the start codons of each gene in the list (collapsing
sites if they occurred within 25 nt of one another). The precise
locations of all GREs for the {\it H. salinarum} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dpp }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{dpp}} \DIFaddend operon-related
corems (Figure 3) are listed in Table E8, while the locations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend GREs
involved in conditional modulation of the PurR regulon (Figure 4) are
provided in Table E9.

We represented the active GREs upstream of a gene or within a corem as
a pie chart, showing the normalized frequency with which the GREs
computed above occurred in biclusters containing that gene. For
example, if GREs 1, 2, and 3 occurred in 25, 50, and 200 biclusters
containing gene \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$A$}\DIFaddend , the pie chart for gene \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$A$ }\DIFaddend would have sectors of area
0.09, 0.18, and 0.73 respectively. For corems, we computed the
normalized frequency of GREs for all genes of the corem. For example,
if GREs 1, 2, and 3 occurred in promoters of 10, 10, and 20 of the
genes of the corem, their areas would be 0.25, 0.25, and 0.5
respectively.

\label{section:condop}
\DIFadd{Condition-specific }\DIFaddend transcriptional isoforms of operons were predicted
through corem membership. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Specifically, if }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{If }\DIFaddend any of the genes in an operon were found

predicted that the operon had conditional isoforms. Operon annotations

\subsection{Environmental ontology construction and usage}

We recorded a rich \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{meta-data set for all 1495 experiments
conducted for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{set of meta-data for all 1,495 experiments
conducted with }\DIFaddend {\it H. salinarum} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and used for construction of the
}\halo\DIFadd{~ }\egrine\DIFadd{~model}\DIFaddend . The meta-data includes a detailed description
of each experiment, including, for example: media composition, genetic
background, concentration of perturbant, internal reference batch id,
person who conducted the experiment, etc. We used this
meta-information to classify experiments in an ontological framework,
where two experiments can share specific meta-descriptions (\eg,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1e-3
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$10^{-3}$ }\DIFaddend mol/L EDTA), or inherit more general relationships from the
ontological structure (\eg, chemical perturbation). We used OBO-edit
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Day-Richter2007}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend to construct the ontology. The ontology contained 198
terms organized across three primary branches (environmental state,
experimental state, and genetic state). The ontology flat file is
available for download and meta-data annotations for every array in
the dataset are available \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{online}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \href{http://egrin2.systemsbiology.net}{online}\DIFaddend .

We used the ontology to classify enriched environmental features for
GREs and corems (Figures 3-4). For corems, we used the set of
conditions in which genes in the corem are significantly co-expressed
(see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{9 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Section \ref{section:rsd} }\DIFaddend above) to compute term enrichment using the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ontoCAT
R-package}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \tmsamp{ontoCAT}
\DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kurbatova2011}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\tmsamp{R}\DIFadd{-package}\DIFaddend . Term enrichment was assessed
statistically and reported as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{q-values }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$q$-values }\DIFaddend using the hypergeometric test
with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing.
